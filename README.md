# This is practice manipulating existing HTML text from Javascript
## Todo:
    * [✔] create a screen (create HTML & enable both CSS & JS with it)
    * [✔] enable screen to be targeted
    * [✔] write function that changes screen
    * [✔] create several elements that invoke previous function with element info when clicked
    * [✔] pass element value into screen when element is clicked
